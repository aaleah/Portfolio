I am currently a junior at Kent-Meridian High School and a Running Start Student at Green River College. I am very punctual; doing things with great diligence and hope to make things better. After my graduation in 2021, I plan on receiving my general AS degree on Computer Science and I plan to transfer to the University of Washington. One of my highlights is joining a summer immersion program called Girls Who Code. For 7-weeks, I've learned to love STEM and expand my knowledge of computer science. On my free time, I love photography, video editing, and film-making. I play sports such as volleyball and tennis. ";
