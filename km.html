<p id=Kent-Meridian High>
  As an incoming junior who hasn't taken the PSAT because my school doesn't offer it, I'm beyond stressed.However, I have a stable group of friends and supportive teachers to help me succeed... woohoo! Weird flex but I'm apart of the student body. My main role, Student Life Director is to help priortize the students needs and wants.
